# GitHub Assistant

Easily ask questions about your GitHub repository using RAG.

### Key Considerations:
- **Quality of Data**: The output is only as good as the inputâ€”ensure your data is clean and well-structured.
- **Chunk Size**: Proper chunking of data is crucial for optimal performance.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Regularly assess the performance of your RAG-based application.

This project allows you to interact directly with a GitHub repository and leverage semantic search to understand the codebase. Ask specific questions about the repository's code and receive meaningful, context-aware responses.

### Components
- **Elasticsearch**: Serves as the vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.
- **LlamaIndex**: A framework for building applications powered by LLM.
- **OpenAI**: Used for both the LLM and generating embeddings.

### Architecture

![Github RAG](./images/github-rag.png)

The process starts by cloning a GitHub repository locally to the `/tmp` directory. The `SimpleDirectoryReader` is then used to load the cloned repository for indexing. Documents are split into chunks based on file type, utilizing `CodeSplitter` for code files, along with `JSON`, `Markdown`, and `SentenceSplitters` for other formats. After parsing the nodes, embeddings are generated using the `text-embedding-3-large` model and stored in Elasticsearch. This setup enables semantic search, allowing us to ask meaningful questions about the code.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/framsouza/github-assistant.git
   cd github-assistant
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
Update the `.env` file with your Elasticsearch credentials and the target GitHub repository details (eg, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`, `GITHUB_BRANCH`, `ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID`, `ELASTIC_USER`, `ELASTIC_PASSWORD`, `ELASTIC_INDEX`).

### Usage

1. **Index your data and create the embeddings by running**:
   ```bash
   python index.py
    ```

An Elasticsearch index will be generated, housing the embeddings. You can then connect to your ESS deployment and run search query against the index, you will see a new field named `embeddings`.

2. **Ask questions about your codebase by running**:
   ```bash
   python query.py
    ```
**Example:**
 ```
python query.py
