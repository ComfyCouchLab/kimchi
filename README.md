# GitHub  Assistant

_WIP_

This project allows you to interact with a specific GitHub repository as if you were having a conversation with it. Essentially, you can pose questions about the code directly to the repository.

Tools:
- **Elasticsearch**: Vector Database
- **LlamaIndex**: LLM Framework
- **HuggingFace**: Build applications using Machine Learning
